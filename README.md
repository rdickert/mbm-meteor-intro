# Meteor Boulder Demo 

This app was live-coded from scratch in about 25 minutes at the first meeting of the Meteor Boulder Meetup on December 3, 2013. It is similar to the app demoed in the famous first Meteor video, with a pinch of Bootstrap to pretty it up quickly.

Some code was added to seed data in the app (we added it live at the event).

## To Run

* [Install Meteor](http://docs.meteor.com/#quickstart). Windows users [look here](http://win.meteor.com/).
* Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/rdickert/mbm-meteor-intro`
* `cd` into the directory created and run `meteor`.
